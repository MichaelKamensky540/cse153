    "## What is ARP Spoofing?\n",
    "\n",
    "ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Spoofing is a type of cyber attack where an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local network. This results in the linking of the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Once the attackerâ€™s MAC address is associated with an authentic IP address, the attacker can receive any data intended for that IP address. This can lead to various malicious activities such as man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, and session hijacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Who are the actors of an ARP Poisson.\n",
    "## Lab Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are going to implement a tool to perform ARP Spoofing. This will help you understand the mechanics of the attack and the potential security implications. You will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Craft and send ARP packets\n",
    "- Redirect network traffic\n",
    "- Analyze the impact of ARP Spoofing on network communication\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will have a practical understanding of ARP Spoofing and the importance of securing networks against such attacks."
